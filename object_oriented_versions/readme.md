# Object-Oriented Versions of Leetle.app Solutions

This folder contains Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) implementations of the solutions to problems from [Leetle.app](https://leetle.app/). These solutions are alternative versions that may or may not work as the solution for the daily challenges despite the code being correct.

 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While the original solutions are functional and work as expected, these versions of codes are meant to help me learn Object-Oriented Programming.
